                        <p>
                            Our Returns Policy forms part of, and must be read in conjunction with, our Terms and Conditions of Sale. We reserve the right to change this Returns Policy at any time. This Returns Policy was last updated on 13/08/2014. It is important that you check
                            your order or items upon receipt and always before use. If any errors occur or issues arise then these need to be reported to us immediately so we can investigate. Before attempting to return an order or item you will need to contact
                            our customer service team to request a returns authorisation number. Without this number it can be difficult to process your return meaning the process may take longer.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You have the right to cancel this contract within 14 days without giving reason. The cancellation and return period will expire after 14 days from the day on which you acquire, or a third party other than the carrier and indicated by you acquires physical
                            possession of the goods. To exercise the right to cancel, you must inform us of your decision to cancel this contract by a clear statement (e.g. by selecting the appropriate option in your account or a letter sent by post).
                            You may use the example model cancellation form below, but it is not obligatory. Please ensure that the items you are returning are unopened and in any original packaging. Unwanted goods need to be in pristine condition with
                            any retail seals unbroken.

                        <p>
                            If you cancel this contract, we will reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the cost of delivery (except for supplementary costs arising if you chose a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of
                            standard delivery offered by us). We may make a deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value of any goods supplied if the loss is the result of unnecessary handling by you. We will make the reimbursement without undue
                            delay and not later than: (a) 14 days after the day we receive back from you any goods supplied; or (b) (if earlier) 14 days after the day you provide evidence that you have returned the goods; or (c) if there were no goods
                            supplied, 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel the contract. We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly
                            agreed otherwise. In any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement. You will have to bear the direct cost of returning the goods.
