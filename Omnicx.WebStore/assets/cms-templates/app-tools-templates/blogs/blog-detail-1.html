            <p>With the trend towards creating open plan living spaces, galley kitchens, which are typically long and narrow, can present a problem to homeowners. While in some properties it may be possible to remove a wall and open the kitchen up, for many, whether due to the style of the property or budget constraints, the only solution is to make the most of the existing space.<br />
            Galley kitchens, while often small, are in fact pretty efficient in terms of design and great for cooking (many professional kitchens adopt a galley style design) as the ‘cooking triangle’, (fridge to hob to sink), is often perfectly positioned.<br />
            If you are wondering how to make the most of your galley kitchen, check out our top seven tips which could help you turn your unloved galley, into the kitchen of your dreams…&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Double up</strong><br>
                    The ideal layout within a galley kitchen is for a double run of units, this offers the maximum amount of cupboard and worktop space. If the space isn’t quite wide enough to warrant a double run, consider whether it would fit a single run along one wall and then a narrower worktop along the other, (your kitchen fitter should be able to cut the worktop to the desired size), helping to create the illusion of width and offering additional worktop space.

                    <strong>Add an eating area</strong><br>
                    A clear drawback of a galley kitchen is that due to their size, fitting in a table is often unfeasible. However, if faced with a long galley kitchen it may be possible to install a breakfast bar area, while not creating the open-plan kitchen/ diner many of us aim for, it does help the space become more social.

                    <strong>Make the most of natural light</strong><br>
                    Natural light helps make the most of any space, often helping it to feel bigger and brighter. If your galley kitchen has little natural light, look at ways it could be introduced – for example, if the kitchen is the product of an extension, could a roof window be installed? Also, keep window dressings to a minimum to ensure the most amount of light can come in. Where the space is naturally dark, introduce a choice of lighting, from bright task lighting to ambient lighting for evenings.
