                <p>Founded in Rochester, New York almost a century ago, Champion started out life crafting high-quality sweatshirts and sweatpants for University and College sports teams local to New York City. The brand’s reputation soon spread, and before long Champion was the go-to apparel sportswear manufacturer for sports teams across the US. The brand expanded its range while retaining its focus on premium quality sportswear, and Champion’s fame continued to grow as it was adopted by professional sports teams and the US Military Academy as their official uniform maker.</p>

                <p><strong>The Champion Reverse Weave— A History</strong></p>
                <p>TheSince it was first imagined in 1934, the Reverse Weave technique has been regarded as a pioneering method in manufacturing sports sweatshirts. The idea of the Reverse Weave came from the American coaches of the 1940s in order to be able to wash the uniforms of their athletes all together without the risk of damaging them. To avoid horizontal shrinkage, the fibre fleece is turned upright at the time of creation, hence the name Reverse Weave.To avoid shrinkage instead in the opposite direction all Reverse Weave sweatshirts, are characterized by the two side panels on the sides. Even cuffs, neck and bottom of the sweatshirts Reverse Weave have the same characteristic of the inserts in order to avoid the dispersion of heat during and after training, keeping the freedom of movement.During the 1960s Champion entered into an intensive licensing program, which started with the National College Athletic Association (NCAA) and expanded in the 1970s with a partnership with the National Football League (NFL).</p>
